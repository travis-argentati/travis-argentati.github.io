<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
<p>This is my first try!</p>
<h2>Homework 1:</h2>
<p>Html is the language that I used in high school. It will take some time for me to get used to html again but I enjoyed using it in high school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The section that stood out to me in chapter one is section 3, the section about the stone soup.</p>
<p>This stood out to me because it shows that when people come together with the resources they have, they can make something great.</p>
<p>Most development companies have their employees work thgether in teams, so it is important that the members are able to come together with what knowledge they have to make the product work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In high school I learned how to insert pictures, links, tables, and how to format the text with different fonts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> <strong>This</strong> is a <em>third</em> paragraph with formatting. </p>
